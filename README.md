## üìÇ File Structure
* `run.py`: The main script that runs the quiz game. Handles user input, displays questions, and provides feedback.
  
* `questions.py`: Contains quiz questions categorized by topic and difficulty level. Provides functions to retrieve and filter questions.

## üîç Functions Overview
### `run.py`
* `get_user_name()`
    * Prompts the user to create a name. Ensures the input is non-empty.

    * Returns: User's name as a string.

* `display_topic_options()`
    * Displays a list of available quiz topics to choose from.

* `get_topic_selection()`
    * Prompts the user to select a valid topic option from 1 to 5.

    * Returns: Selected topic option as a string.

* `provide_feedback(score, total_questions)`
    * Provides feedback based on the user's score out of the total number of questions.

* `end_of_quiz_prompt()`
    * Prompts the user to decide whether to return to the home page or exit the game.

      * Returns: Boolean value (`True` for "home" and `False` for "exit").

* `main()`
    * Runs the main quiz game setup, handles user interactions, and tracks the score. It controls the flow of the game, from selecting topics to providing feedback and managing game sessions.
### `questions.py`
1. `get_questions()`

    * Returns a dictionary of quiz questions categorized by topic and difficulty level.
  
2. `ask_multiple_questions(topic, difficulty_level)`

# üß™ Testing
To ensure the functionality of your quiz game, I followed these testing guidelines:

## 1. Unit Testing
 * To verify that each function in run.py and questions.py behaves as expected.

* Setup:

  - Ensured I had Python installed.

    ### Testing Functions in `run.py`:
      * `get_user_name()`:
        * Tested with different inputs, including valid names and empty strings.
        * Ensured it correctly handles empty inputs and returns a valid name.

      * `get_topic_selection()`:
        * Tested with valid and invalid inputs.
        * Ensured it returns a valid topic option and prompts again for 
        invalid inputs.

    * `provide_feedback(score, total_questions)`:
        * Tested with different score and total question values.
        * Verified that the feedback message corresponds to the score ranges.
    
    * `end_of_quiz_prompt()`:
        * Tested with valid inputs ("home" and "exit") and invalid inputs.
        * Ensured it returns True for "home" and False for "exit".

    ### Testing Functions in `questions.py`:

      * `get_questions()`:
        * Verified the structure and content of the returned dictionary.
        * Ensured it contains the correct questions and details for each topic.
      * `ask_multiple_questions(topic, difficulty_level)`:
        * Mock user input to simulate answering questions.
        * Tested with various topics and difficulty levels.
        * Verified that scores are calculated correctly and responses are accurate.

## üêû Bugs
* No bugs remaining
* Bugs such as `variable not defined` were encountered during the development of the application. Corrected by making sure that correct spelling of the variable was used.
* Exception-handling errors: Fixed by providing a user with a meaningfull message if an unexpected value is input.
* trailing whitespace: Indentation was fixed.

## üîÑ Cloning of the Repository Code locally

* Go to the Github repository that you want to clone.
* Click on the Code button located above all the project files.
* Click on HTTPS and copy the repository link.
* Open the IDE of your choice and and paste the copied git url into the IDE terminal.
* The project is now created as a local clone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment
I deployed the Mind Mastery Quiz using Heroku‚Äôs dashboard, which offers an intuitive interface for deploying web applications. Here‚Äôs the process I followed:

* Logged into Heroku: I accessed my Heroku account and went to the dashboard. I clicked the "New" button and selected "Create new app". I then provided a unique name for the app and chose the appropriate region.

* Configuring Environment Variables: I set up the required environment variables in the Heroku dashboard under the "Settings" tab for my application.

* Connecting to GitHub: In the deployment section of my Heroku app dashboard, I chose GitHub as the deployment method. I linked my GitHub account and selected the repository that holds the code for my Mind Mastery code.

* Installing the Python Buildpack: In the settings section of my Heroku app dashboard, I went to the "Buildpacks" area and added the Python Buildpack. This step was necessary to ensure that my application could manage the Python dependency required for the template.

* Configuring Automatic Deploys: Once GitHub was connected, I enabled automatic deploys for my app. This setup allowed Heroku to automatically deploy updates whenever I pushed changes to the linked GitHub repository.

* Manual Deployments: I also had the option to manually trigger deployments from the dashboard. I could choose a branch to deploy and start the deployment process with a single click.

* Verifying Deployment: After the deployment process was complete, I checked that my application was functioning correctly by visiting the Heroku URL provided in my web browser.
